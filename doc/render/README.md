This directory contains translations of the OMOP CDM to Python-Alchemy modules,
as peformed by calling the command `topomop-convert`.

At this time I am not sure about whether the files should be in the package's
source code, or even about whether they should be part of the repository.
For now, their inclusion will allow to show the code generated through
git/Github.
